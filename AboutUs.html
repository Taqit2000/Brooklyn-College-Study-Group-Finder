	<p> Brooklyn College is an integral part of the civic, urban, and artistic energy of New York and uses the entire city as a living classroom that broadens our students’ understanding of the world around them.

For more than 90 years, the college has been attracting a wide variety of motivated students—many of them immigrants or the children of immigrants who wish to better their lives through a superb education. They come because of the college’s renowned faculty of academics, professionals, and artists who are among the best in their field. They know they will be learning on a campus considered one of the most beautiful in the country, with well-equipped facilities, studios, smart classrooms, and production and practice rooms—all with a highly affordable tuition.

Brooklyn College has a student enrollment of 15,938 students—13,405 undergraduates and 2,533 graduates—who come from 136 nations and speak 91 languages.

The college offers 175 undergraduate degree, graduate degree, certificate, and advanced certificate and diploma programs in business; education; the humanities and social sciences; natural and behavioral sciences; and visual, media, and performing arts. More than 4,000 students received bachelor’s and master’s degrees, as well as certificates and advanced certificates and diplomas, at our last Commencement.</p>
